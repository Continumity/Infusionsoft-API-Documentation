					</ul>
					<h4>Detailed Explenation</h4>
					<p>First thing to keep in mind when learning about the Infusionsoft rate limiting system is that throttling happens only for the app, and not the API client.
					For example, if a customer has purchased 3 add-ons, each of the add-ons must compete with the others for the API credits.</p>
					<p>So the application starts with 0 credits, and every 500ms the application has no API traffic a credit is rewarded. 
					If nothing happends for about 16 minutes then the application will reach the max number of credits that can be accumulated, which is 2000.
					Now, let's suppose they start a large sync of their database (10,000 records).  
					Their API client will blow through the 2000 accumulated credits as fast as they can until they hit zero.  
					Once they hit zero, they will have to wait for 500ms to earn a new credit.  
					Each subsequent call will be blocked (on the Infusionsoft side) until 500ms has passed from the time the previous api call was completed.  
					In essence, it will appear to the API client that each call is taking exactly 500ms (plus/minus network latency).  
					As long as these calls are made in succession in a single thread, no API calls will be rejected.</p>
					<p>As soon as you throw a second thread at it, it will appear to the API client that calls are now taking 1s apiece.  
					This is due to the fact that there are twice as many threads competing for the same number of resources.  
					In this circumstance, it is essentially guaranteed that both threads will end up blocked at the same time.  
					This obviously poses a problem, as a customer could easily throw a couple hundred threads at the API and cause a thread starvation issue for the web server.</p>
					<p>This is why we have a limit to the number of threads that can be throttled at any given time.  
					Keep in mind, it's not the number of threads that can access the API at any given time – as long as they have the credits, they can use as many threads as they'd like.  
					It's only when they start being throttled that we care.  
					Currently, if there are 3 threads throttled and a 4th attempts to access the API – and there still isn't a credit available, the 4th will be rejected with an error message.</p>
